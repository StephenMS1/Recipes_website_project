    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the aubergine and courgette into 2.5cm dice and toss with a dessertspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>Pack the aubergine and courgette into a colander and use a weight to compress and drain the liquid. Leave for approximately 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Arrange the aubergine, courgette, tomatoes and onion in a roasting tin. Sprinkle with chopped garlic, basil and olive oil to coat.</li>
            <li>Roast the vegetables for 30-40 minutes at 220°c.</li>
            <li>During this; make the sauce by first melting butter in a saucepan and whisking in the flour.</li>
            <li>Incorporate the milk into the butter/flour mix gradually whilst whisking to ensure a smooth sauce.</li> 
            <li>Add most of the parmesan (leaving some for sprinkling on top of the lasagne) to the sauce along with the grated nutmeg and bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Allow the sauce to infuse and thicken by bringing to the boil and turning the heat down to the lowest setting for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce and vegetables are done, create the lasagne by alternating layers of sauce, vegetables, mozarella and the lasagne sheets.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining parmesan over the top of the lasagne.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagne in the oven for 30 minutes at 180°c or until the top is browned and crispy.</li>
